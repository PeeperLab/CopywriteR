Description: ENCODER generate DNA copy number profiles from whole exome sequencing by analysing the ‘off-target’ sequence reads. By exploiting the ‘off-target’ sequence reads, it allows for creation of robust copy number profiles from WES with a uniform read depth and evenly distributed data points over the genome.
